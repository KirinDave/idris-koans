idris-koans
===========

Koans are small lessons on the path to enlightenment.
The aim of the Idris Koans project is to provide an easy learning environment in which you can learn Idris, and Functional Programming..
Your insight will be derived by encountering failing code and fixing them so that it type checks.

Within the `Koans` folder you will find the lessons.
The lessons each address various topics within Functional Programming, and also topics specific to Idris.
Each lesson consists of a series of functions that when passed through the Idris type checker will fail to type check, or have the wrong behaviour.
To pass each lesson each function needs to be completed or fixed so that it type checks , or has deterministic behaviour..

The files should be attempted in the following order:

1. 01-Arithmetic.idr
1. 02-Equality.idr
1. 03-Boolean.idr
1. 04-Ranges.idr
1. 05-Lists.idr
1. 06-ListComprehensions.idr

You can run each lesson by simply loading each file in Idris.
